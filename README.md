# Budget-Booster
Budget Boost records income and spending. It uses this information to calculate net income and analyses which categories to budget in. The inspiration for this financial planning app comes from the realization that many people struggle to keep track of their finances and plan for their future. In a 'perma-crisis' world, where people are cancelling subscriptions, pausing contributions to pensions and abandoning life and health insurance, we would like to help users become more conscientious of how they track and spend their money!
